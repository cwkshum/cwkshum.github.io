	    		<hr>
	    		<p>During the summer of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, I created videos for the graduating dancers at 
					<a href="https://www.panoramadance.com/about-us/" target="_blank">Panorama School of Dance</a> as well as 
					the summer camps that the studio was running. Due to the restrictions that the province had in place 
					that summer, this allowed the dancers to have a digital memory of their performances as well as a 
					photo slideshow. I was responsible for editing together the video clips and compiling the photos 
					together to form a comprehensive video using Adobe Premiere Pro that was then shared with the families.</p>

	    	<div class="process-description">
				<p>Before editing together the video for the 2020 graduates, I was invited to attend their outdoor performance 
					to film the dance as well as take photographs of the event and each dancer for the final video. I was also 
					sent additional video clips from their rehearsal practices to include in the video.</p>
				
				<p>When it was time to edit together the video, I put a message from the studio’s artistic director at the beginning 
					that served as an introduction. I proceeded to split the video up into different parts using title cards to show
					the process that the dancers went through before their final graduation dance. The first part showcased their
					Zoom practices where I used clips of their recorded sessions, while the second part consisted of their
					in-studio rehearsals. This all led up to their final outdoor performance where I seamlessly cut between two 
					different shots for a variation in angles to capture all the dancers. I also overlaid the song that was used to
					increase sound quality instead of having to rely on the sound from the original recording. I then included a 
					section afterwards that featured all the graduates, with their individual photo and their name on display. 
					Lastly, I included a credits section at the end and paired it with some of the extra photographs I took on 
					their performance day. The final video can be viewed below.</p>

				<p>For the summer camp videos, I was sent performance recordings, clips containing camp highlights, as well as 
					pictures that were taken during the week of the camp. During that summer, the studio held five camps, each 
					with a different theme. My approach when editing these videos was to create a short animated introduction with 
					vector graphics that matched the camp’s theme. For instance, the Brightfeather camp was magic themed, so I 
					utilized stars and a wand to capture the theme in the intro. In order to get the vectors to move, I used keyframes 
					while editing, which allowed me to transform, rotate, or translate the vectors on screen. I then put together the 
					clips using Adobe Premiere Pro and utilized Adobe Photoshop to create the slides for the slideshow of pictures that 
					were taken at the camp. For the slideshow, I continued with the theme of the video and added supporting vector 
					graphics that were related to that specific camp.</p>
				
				<p>The intros for the five summer dance camps can be viewed below. For confidentiality purposes, the full video of 
					the summer camps which include performances, camp highlights, and a photo slideshow is not shown.</p>
