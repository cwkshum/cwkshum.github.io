	    		<hr>
	    		<p>During the summer of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, I created videos for the graduating dancers at  
					<a href="https://www.panoramadance.com/about-us/" target="_blank">Panorama School of Dance</a> (PSOD) as well as the summer camps that the studio was running as a freelance job. Due to the restrictions that the province had in place that summer, this allowed the dancers to have a digital memory of their performances as well as a photo slideshow. I was responsible for editing together the video clips and compiling the photos together to form a comprehensive video using Adobe Premiere Pro that was then shared with the families.</p>

				<p>Before editing together the video for the 2020 graduates, I was invited to attend their outdoor performance to film the dance as well as take photographs of the event and each dancer for the final video. I was also sent additional video clips from their rehearsal practices to include in the video.</p>
				
				<p>When it was time to edit together the video in Adobe Premiere Pro, I put a message from the studio’s artistic director at the beginning that served as an introduction. I proceeded to split the video up into different parts using title cards to show the process that the dancers went through before their final graduation dance. The first part showcased their Zoom practices where I used clips of their recorded sessions, while the second part consisted of their in-studio rehearsals. This all led up to their final outdoor performance where I seamlessly cut between two different shots for a variation in angles to capture all the dancers. I also overlaid the song that was used to increase sound quality instead of having to rely on the sound from the original recording. I then included a section afterwards that featured all the graduates, with their individual photo and their name on display. Lastly, I included a credits section at the end and paired it with some of the extra photographs I took on their performance day. The final video can be viewed below.</p>

				<p>For the summer camp videos, I was sent performance recordings, clips containing camp highlights, as well as pictures that were taken during the week of the camp. During that summer, the studio held five camps, each with a different theme. My approach when editing these videos was to create a short animated introduction with vector graphics that matched the camp’s theme. For instance, the Brightfeather camp was magic themed, so I utilized stars and a wand to capture the theme in the intro. In order to get the vectors to move, I used keyframes while editing, which allowed me to transform, rotate, or translate the vectors on screen. I then put together the clips using Adobe Premiere Pro and utilized Adobe Photoshop to create the slides for the slideshow of pictures that were taken at the camp. For the slideshow, I continued with the theme of the video and added supporting vector graphics that were related to that specific camp.</p>

	    		<p>In order to get these videos to the families as quickly as possible, I was able to complete and finalize each video within two days after receiving the necessary content. Overall, this experience has helped me feel more confident working with video editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, to piece together clips to create a cohesive video while still adding a creative aspect to it through the use of keyframe animations for the vector images. I was also able to utilize my design skills to create a layout for the photo slideshow in Adobe Photoshop as well as how to format the introduction of each camp video. </p>
